</div>

The `ProtoSound` contract allows users to create songs setting a price and minting 3 types of tokens, an `AuthorSongCover` Soulbound token, an `AuthorSongAudio` Soulbound token, and a collection of `SongCover` NFT tokens. 

When another user wants to buy and consume a song, after paying the price, one of the mentioned `SongCover` tokens are randomly selected from the collection and transferred to the buyer. Aquiring a new NFT token plus the song itself.
